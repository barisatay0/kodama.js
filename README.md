## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with **Kodama.js**, ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the tool:

1. **Install Kodama.js globally via npm** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   npm i -g kodama.js
   ```
   Alternatively, you can install it locally in your project:
   ```bash
   npm i kodama.js
   ```

   Or clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barisatay0/kodama.js.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd kodama.js
   npm install
   ```

3. If you didn't install the CLI globally, use the `npm link` command:
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```
   After running `npm link`, the `koda` command becomes globally available on your system, enabling you to generate API components anywhere.
