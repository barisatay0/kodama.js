## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with Kodama.js, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, follow these steps to set up the tool:

1. Install Kodama.js directly from npm:
   ```bash
   npm i kodama.js
   ```
   
   Or clone the repository:

## ‚ö° Commands

Kodama.js provides a variety of commands to make API development faster and easier:

### Create Commands

- **Controller**: Generate a new controller file:
  ```bash
  koda create controller <controller_name>
  ```

- **Service**: Generate a new service file:
  ```bash
  koda create service <service_name>
  ```

- **Model**: Generate a new model file:
  ```bash
  koda create model <model_name>
  ```

- **API**: Generate a controller, service, and model file all at once:
  ```bash
  koda create api <api_name>
  ```

### Example Usage

1. To create a controller named `UserController`:
   ```bash
   koda create controller User
   ```

2. To create an entire API for `User`:
   ```bash
   koda create api User
   ```
   This will generate the following files:
   - `UserController.js`
   - `UserService.js`
   - `UserModel.js`
